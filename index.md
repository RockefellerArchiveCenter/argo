## What is an API? 

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of instructions that tells one software application how to "talk to", or transmit data, to another. If you have used [DIMES](https://dimes.rockarch.org/), our site to enable search and access to our collections, you have seen our API in action. For example, when you initiate a search for something in DIMES, your browser makes a request to the API, which delivers the data as the search results. With the API, you can bypass the website interface and instead send requests directly to get the data. With direct access, you can explore the data in different ways and build new things.

## Who can use our API? 

Anyone can use it! We have made it publicly available to enable people like you to freely access the data. There is no sign up or authentication required, although you may want to browse this documentation, which shows you have to make requests. [The best place to start is...]

### What is the data and where does it come from? 

Our archival holdings are arranged and described by Rockefeller Archive Center archivists to make them accessible and facilitate use by providing information about their content and context. Archivists create descriptive information about: 

1. Archival records
2. Agents, who are records creators and other people, organizations, and families related to the records
3. Relevant biographical, historical, or administrative activities
4. The relationships between these records, agents and activities.

All of this information is managed in its own system, and it is made available in the API. The API also includes data used specifically in the DIMES website that improves search and discovery on the site.

Learn more about what data is available by [browsing the available endpoints](#) *[add link]*, or points of entry to communicate with the API about specific resources.

### Licensing 

This data is released under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) public domain dedication. See our [full licensing statement](https://docs.rockarch.org/archival-description-license/) for specific license terms as well as best practices for repurposing this data.

## What can I do with it? 

You can use the API to get our collections data, and you can use that data in any way you like. Build applications, visualize and analyze data in new ways, search and browse, make new connections.
